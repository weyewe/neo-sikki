1. deceased
2. run_away declaration
3. uncollectibles
4. premature_clearance 

That's it. 




hard data => deceased can't be created if there is premature clearance
run_away can't be created if there is premature clearance..

Then, how can we do it? Delete the premature clearance
Then, create deceased and run away
Finally, re-create the premature clearance. 


=> Then, we have to test that post premature clearance creation, can't create deceased or run_away.
