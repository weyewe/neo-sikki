UangTitipan (liability)   => PrematureClearanceDeposit 

	On premature clearance, if there is run away member and has to be paid weekly,
		the premature clearance applicant has to leave deposit to pay for the run-away member weekly payment.
		
	On weekly payment, containing 1 run_away member, paid weekly + 1 premature clearance 
	
		=> weekly, has to be manual => PrematureClearanceDepositUsage 
		
		# oh , in the premature Clearance Declaration, put the deposit amount 
		
		
Data to be logged in the GroupLoan
1. Total Premature Clearance Deposit
2. Remaining Premature Clearance Deposit

detailed transaction, he should look at TransactionActivity.


In practice: how can the usage of PrematureClearanceDeposit should be used? 
when can a compulsory savings can be used to cover for all the remaining weekly payment?

(n - x)*m*weekly_payment = x*k*weekly_payment   ; 
; where 0< k < 1  
; where 0< m < 1 
; k is the percentage of weekly payment used for compulsory savings 
; m is the percentage of weekly payment used for principle payment 


nm = mx + xk
n*m = x( k+m )
x = n*m/(k+m)

example: k=0.2; m = 0.6; n = 24 
x = 17.9 => 18 ..  after week 18, the compulsory savings can be used to pay for all remaining 
principal.

In the premature clearance, sum of all remaining principal - compulsory savings has to be paid.. 

what if compulsory_savings > sum of all remaining_principals + default_contribution? 
 => deduct compulsory savings. port it into voluntary savings. withdraw the voluntary savings. done. 


=================
Rounding down 
=====================

group of 14 people
1 run away => 777.777 Rupiah of principal + interest
Total savings per person = 250k IDr.. 
=> Total compulsory savings = 3,250k IDR

ok, treat this shite as a group. 


The compulsory savings returned at the end of cycle: allow the member to decide on 
the share. 

Ideology: shifting risk to group. 


===============
New Design
==============

1. KKI is not responsible on returning the compulsory savings post group-loan-closing.
It will give the bulk $$ to the group. Group is responsible of taking care for themselves.

Hence, no porting from compulsory savings to voluntary savings. 
	On GroupLoanClose => the field worker can withdraw all compulsory savings on behalf of member. 


2. Default Resolution: KKI treats it as a bulk. No  member-specific default resolution 

3. For Premature Clearance, if there is run_away member, default resolved at end of the cycle, then there has to be premature_clearance_deposit that will be used to cover for the monthly payment.


4. How is the mechanic to use PrematureDepositClearance? 
Group Loan hold the total remaining amount. 

Collect the $$ from the member



==========
PrematureDepositClearance.. weekly collection amount for run away member + weekly_default_resolution.. 

It's all has to be full weeks... Cashier has to confirm the amount => 

total cash == weekly_collection_amount - premature_deposit_usage 

if cash == actual cash, confirm it. Banzai! lovey dovey. 

new definition of transaction_activity: it is used to track all payments from member. 

TransactionActivity: impacting the cash coming and going out from the member. 

VoluntarySavings + WeeklyPayment + EndOfCycleDefaultResolution 

not recording the compulsory savings.
