Case 1
1. RunAway (weekly resolution): it won't debit bad debt allowance
2. RunAway (end_of_cycle resolution): it will debit bad debt allowance

Case 2
1. RunAway( weekly resolution ) + Premature Clearance 
		There will be premature clearance deposit. However, such premature clearance deposit won't be kept. In fact, it is used to reduce the run_away bail_out : principal + interest + compulsory_savings 
		
		The compulsory savings element will be returned at the end of the cycle. So, we are only taking the bare minimum. 
		
2. RunAway( end_of_cycle resolution ) + PrematureClearance
	WeeklyCollection won't include the payment for the run away member. 
	PrematureClearance Deposit will be returned at the end of loan_cycle post bad_allowance deduction 
	
	
Rule
Rule 1
If there is a run_away declared on a given week, the admin is able to change resolution method (weekly or end_of_cycle) if the weekly collection is not confirmed. 

Rule 2
At the end of loan_cycle, we will return a bulk amount of 
compulsory_savings + 
premature_clearance_deposit - 
expected_interest_from_run_away, end_of_cycle resolution - 
bad_debt_allowance

Priority: 
1. recover  expeceted_interest_revenue_from_run_away
2. Recover BadDebt
