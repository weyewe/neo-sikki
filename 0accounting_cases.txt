Loan Disbursement

1. Basic loan disbursement, no corner cases

Weekly Collection, combination of 6 key-drivers of headache: 

1. Pay for the weekly payment
2. confirm uncollectibles 
3. run_away allowance, end_of_cycle
	# when runaway is declared, regardless of the clearance type (in_cycle of end_of_cycle) => bad debt allocation
	# 

	==> what if it is run_away_allowance, but paid in cycle? No need for allowance then. 
	
	treat it as if the member	is not running away 
	
4. deceased_allowance
5. premature_clearance 
6. extra_revenue from collection rounding_up


So, our accounting test scenario:
Standard
1. Test the basic loan disbursement
2. normal: only transaction from weekly_payment_collection [1]
3. normal +  run_away, decided to be paid_in_cycle [2]
	a. what's gonna happen to next week's collection amount?
	b. what's gonna happen to the end-of-loan closing? 
	c. what's gonna happen to this week's collection amount, taking account of this corner cases?
4. normal +  run_away, decided to be at the end of the cycle [2]
5. normal + deceased_allowance
6. normal + premature_clearance
7. normal + uncollectibles 


question to be asked on each scenarios:
a. what's gonna happen to next week's collection amount?
b. what's gonna happen to the end-of-loan closing? 
c. what's gonna happen to this week's collection amount, taking account of this corner cases?

when does corner cases happen?
a. parallel: 2 corner cases happening on 1 weekly collection
b. sequential: the corner cases happened one after another weekly collection 

# if we are gonna perform integration test, taking 2 corner cases, we will have 3 x 5 x 5 x 2 cases = 150 cases 


Combination cases: combination between run_away, deceased, premature_clearance, uncollectibles

At most, there will be 4^4 cases to be tested:  4x4x4x4 = 256 cases

Impossible to test. 

We will take risk by testing only 1 case with all the factor presents:
collection with 
	run_away_weekly_collection  + 
	premature_clearance + 
	uncollectible + 
	deceased    << on the same week
