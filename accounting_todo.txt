easy transaction:
1. Loan disbursement
2. Manual savings => Voluntary, locked
3. Loan weekly payment 
4. Corner cases: Run Away, Death, Uncollectible, Premature Clearance 
5. Rounding Up
6. Compulsory Savings inequality 


produces bad debt allowance
run away
	declaration: bad debt allowance  OK 
		weekly_payment
			reverse the bad debt allowance OK 
		end_of_cycle
			reverse the bad debt allowance  
			
death
	auto bad_debt_allowance   OK 
	 
uncollectible 
	produces bad debt allowance
	1. in_cycle_collection
		will revert the bad debt allowance: OK.
	
	2. end_of_week collection
		bad_debt allowance will be solved at the end of the loan.
		total amount to be offset: total_principal_from_run_away + principal_of_uncollectible 
	

premature clearance: produces liability (uang titipan)?

at the end of the loan (closing)
total_bad_debt_allowance - uang_titipan - total_compulsory_savings > 0  ? << 


Guideline for group loan closing:
	1. all bad debt allowance , except the one from force major (deceased) should be minimized
	2. it can be paid by using compulsory savings 



During closing, we will try to minimize bad debt allowance. 
compulsory savings - bad debt allowance. 
	if there is still debt, expense it
	no debt: return it. 
	
CASE:
week 2: run_away in_cycle
week 3: premature_clearance
week 4: how much should be paid by the member? per normal. no adjustment.


week 2: run_away_end_of_cycle
week 3: premature_clearance
week 4: how much should be paid by each member? per normal, no adjustment. The total== reduced

# closing group loan
bad debts:
	run_away end_of_cycle + uncollectible end_of_cycle [ both of them entails interest revenue ]
	Priority:
	1. principal
	2. interest revenue from run_away and uncollectble
	
liability to be returned to member:
1. uang titipan (deposit)
2. compulsory savings 

if principal > uang titipan + compulsory savings 
	make it bad debt expense 

if principal > uang titipan + compulsory savings, but principal + interest > uang titipan + compulsory savings
	make partial interest revenue   
	
if principal + interest <  uang titipan + compulsory savings
	make full interest revenue
